### Hi there 👋 ... testing 1 2 3...

Computer Science Specialist with a Minor in History and Philosophy of Science @ the University of Toronto. Currently on my Professional-Experience Year (PEY).

My interests are varied, ranging from the ocean, to the stars ✨, music, game development, or even down to really science-y things like AI, or quantum computing.

🔭 I’m currently working on... my own personal website in React (I think it's about time I make one) 👩‍💻  
🌱 I’m currently learning... Unity. Ready to bring my vision of a solar/cyber-punk dystopian city to life!  
⚡ Fun fact: I say all this, but I'm probably just going to spend all my time on Genshin Impact...
